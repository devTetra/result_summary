## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Visual Studio Code
- Chrome Developer Tools

### What I learned
    In this challenge, I learned how to use media queries when wanting to make a website that has to look different on various devices. A snippet of the code I wrote can be seen below:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px) {
    .wrapper
    {
        width: 100vw;
        height: 100vh;
        flex-direction: column;
        border-radius: 0;
        box-shadow: none;
    }
}
```

### Continued development
    The knowledge I have in the use of media queries is still scanty so I want to learn more on media queries, and if possible attempt more challenges that use media queries

### Useful resources
